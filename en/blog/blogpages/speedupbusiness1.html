			William Li (47), (CEO of Bluebell Infotech, Tianjin China - a
			fictitious firm) was returning from a global summit on “Cyber
			Security and Privacy” held in Berlin. Flight was delayed by 2.5
			hours, therefore he decided to relax in VIP lounge. William received
			a call from marketing head ‘Bob’ about securing a key project from a
			new client. He was shocked to hear that delivery is merely 6 months
			away. Last week HR manager briefed that company is losing its
			competitive edge cos of talent crunch. Attrition surpassed 25%,
			hiring managers were struggling hard to find the right talent.
			Inadequate training was leading to late delivery and lower
			satisfaction to clients. <br> <br>Since its inception in
			2006, Bluebell is known to offer cutting edge and top notch solution
			to clients, however since two years company is struggling hard to
			maintain the pace. William knew that in order to grow, primarily
			Bluebell need to sustain in competitive market. But technical
			volatility, economic uncertainty and talent crunch were severely
			hampering his ambitions. <br> <br> <strong>Analysis:</strong>
			The situation is quite common in IT and related industries. CEO cum
			founder invest lifetime in company. Employees are free to switch
			job/career. But most CEOs or top management doesn’t have this luxury.
			According to FORBES only 10% startups survive after 5 years in
			business (<a target="_blank"

				Here</a>). We’ve seen that due to lack of innovation, established
			companies have become history e.g. KODAK, NOKIA, and ENRON etc. <br>
			<br> Let us review why companies fail to deliver-<br>
			<ol class="indexlist">
				<li><strong>Overreliance on Technology:</strong> People drive
					technology not vice versa. Merely investing in latest tools or
					technology will not serve the purpose.</li>
				<li><strong>Unable to reach workforce:</strong> As I mentioned
					in my previous blog “Management-Employee: The Missing Link”, top
					management gets too busy on strategic issues and running after the
					numbers rather than to reach workforce. Especially in IT industries
					– employee works like a robot. They reach office, write code, get
					paid and cycle repeats. Most employees aren’t able to realize the
					vision/mission of enterprise. Visions, and mission merely decorate
					a webpage on corporate websites.</li>
				<li><b>Focus on Management:</b> Top management completely rely
					on middle management. These managers are usually promoted from
					technical roles. Despite being technically competent, often these
					managers lack necessary leadership skills to manage the vibrant
					workforce.</li>
			</ol>
			<br> <br> <strong>Call for Action:</strong> Innovation is
			the key to sustainability and growth. Finally here are the 3 Ways to
			Speed up Business Success and attain Growth and Sustainability.
			<ol class="indexlist">
				<li><b>Focus on UX:</b> According to Gartner reports-Only 30%
					software succeed. Reason is well explained here in this image-</li>
				<img height="400" width="550" src="images/bussuccessp1-2.jpg"
					alt="Business Success Image">

				<li><b>Keep refining priorities and business objectives:</b> No
					strategy is the best strategy. Setting long term visions and
					objectives create bottleneck for enterprises. Instead short term
					wins and keep changing course of action according to market forces
					seems viable strategy.</li>
				<li><b>Hire and retain the best talent:</b> This is the core
					solution to speed up business success and maintain competitive
					edge. <strong>HCM (Human Capital Management) </strong> need to be
					the first and foremost strategic priority.</li>
			</ol>
