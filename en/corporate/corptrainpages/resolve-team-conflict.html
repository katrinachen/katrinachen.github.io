			<br> <b>Leon Huang (30)</b>, (Senior PM in <b>IVX Infotech,
				Wuxi China</b> - a fictitious firm) was updating WBS for an ongoing key
			project for a client in Malaysia. He felt a bit overwhelmed because
			despite taking all necessary precautions and measures, project was
			consistently 12 days behind schedule since more than a week. <span
				style="color: red;"><i>On time delivery</i></span> was first and
			foremost success parameter of this project. Failing this, client will
			have to suffer heavy loss as well as severe negative impact on
			IVX Infotech goodwill in the region. Management has good faith
			on Leon, that’s why this key project was given to Leon. <br> <br>
			During the meeting, backend developers start blaming each other on
			dependency code and non-cooperation issues. Leon realized that issues
			were quite trivial which could have been solved by teamwork and
			communication. Leon write to training manager to provide<b><i><u>
						Team Building and Effective Communication crash courses</u></i></b> to the
			team. <br>Considering sensitivity of issue training manager
			talked extensively to Leon to set clear training objectives and
			customize training contents accordingly. Team received training
			during weekend. Soon after the training, team started working with a
			new spirit towards a common goal, catch up the project schedule and
			deliver product on time. <br> Conflict is a natural part of
			business. It can be an opportunity to discover new approaches to
			challenges at the same time it can also hinder the implementation of
			change within organization or team. Let us review the main reasons
			and solutions of team conflicts: <br> <br>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Lack of Training:</strong> Even though we have
					latest tools and technologies for faster communication. However we
					are drowning in lots of information. It is getting hard to convey
					right information to right people at right time. <br> <strong
					style="color: red; font-weight: bold; background: yellow;">Solution:</strong>
					There is a need for “Effective Communication Training” for entire
					workforce at regular interval. Listening is the key part of
					communication. Employees must be trained to practice “Assertive
					Listening” for better outcome from a dialogue. Also organizations
					need to establish an informal communication channel (e.g.
					professional counselling etc.) to address workforce grievances.</li>

				<li><strong> Cultural (in)competency:</strong> Since childhood
					most people tends to differentiate people based on their race,
					color, class (rich, poor) or ethnicity. At times, unfortunately
					team member rate coworker or clients and compare others based on
					their own biased assumptions. These days team are dispersed
					globally in different time zones. Cultural incompetency plays a big
					role to form a dynamic business team. <br> <strong
					style="color: red; font-weight: bold; background: yellow;">Solution:</strong>
					Team members need to have global perspectives and adaptive approach
					while dealing with coworker and clients. Therefore team need to be
					trained to deal cultural diversity issues as a part of corporate
					learning programs.</li>

				<li><strong> Complex Technology:</strong> These days there are
					100s of framework, languages, tools and databases to deliver
					cutting edge products. It is beyond imagination that someone will
					be competent in many technologies. This situation may leads to lack
					of confidence and team conflict which negatively affect team
					performance.<br>
				<strong style="color: red; font-weight: bold; background: yellow;">Solution:</strong>
					PM/management need to avail and promote various source of learning
					such as buying relevant books, access to websites/portals, online
					or enterprise learning programs, peer learning etc.</li>
					</ol>
