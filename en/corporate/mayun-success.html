				alt="Business Success Image"><br> <br> <b>Y</b>ou
			finish work at 6 pm, go to bed at 12 midnight. Within these six
			hours, how do you spend them? Watching TV? In fact, the activities
			you do between 6 am and 12 midnight, the importance of it is beyond
			your imagination. Too many people believe that, your career is
			determined by the 8 hours of hard work and effort you put at work,
			and your future and career progression depend on the boss and the
			company. But the reality is that for most people, this thing, you are
			on your own….. “Cultivation”, it’s forever dependent by yourself. If
			you found yourself not progressing in life, you cannot blame and put
			the responsibility on your company for not grooming you.<br> <br>

				<li><b>What you do every night is important:</b> My major in
					college was marketing, but I expect to become a designer. So I
					practiced day and night, picking up some freelance work to improve
					my design skills. It took me a long time. When I became a boss, I
					no longer need to involve myself in design work, So I went back to
					the Marketing field.<br> <br> Every day, when my children
					are sleeping, I began learning to gain more knowledge, this again
					took me a long time, But I begin to realise my returns. If I rely
					on my working hours to gain skills, then I will never have become a
					creative director and a product manager, or like today, teaching
					MBA students on Marketing.<br> <br> What I rely on, is
					myself giving myself “lessons”. And the most successful people I
					knew, walked the same path as I am. I have a friend who is a
					History graduate, but he is interested in technical sales, In the
					day, he does telemarketing, at night he learns how to code,
					Finally, he became the vice president of sales in a startup
					company. Now, he’s a CTO.<br> <br> I have another friend,
					he received a degree in political science. But he’s very interested
					in entrepreneurship. he learnt a lot of knowledge on how to start
					up a company, eventually, he founded a company and sold it, Now he
					has reaped the rewards. For them, what they do between 6 pm till 12
					midnight, is what determined their future. Clearly, we need to
					balance life and work.<br> <br> If you have a wife and
					children, every night, you have to stay with them. Even if you are
					single, you also need a reasonable allocation of time to go to the
					gym, to meet with friends, or be alone to meditate and so on. Of
					course, watching movies, playing games is good. But there are
					things you do not need to do. For example, watching the new season
					of a Netflix drama, 14 hours per week watching television (This is
					the average amount of time watching television). The time spent
					playing the game Candy Crush. Or spending time stalking your high
					school alumni on Facebook, it does not seem to be good. So what
					should you do? <br> <br></li>

				<li><b>Read more, anything will do!</b> My college mentor was
					born in Alabama, A poor African family. He was admitted to West
					Point Military Academy, and he became the first person in the
					family to go college. Before going to Havard for his MBA, he’s a
					trained officer. When I met him, he has already developed his
					career in the city of Colorado Springs. I asked him, what’s his
					biggest success? He replied, because he kept the habit of reading,
					and he never stopped. He believed that if you want to get what you
					want in life, knowledge is the key. He often asked his interviewees
					what book are they reading now, the excellent ones can give an
					answer immediately. <br> <br> Reading can give you a good
					headstart, this is often what your peers cannot obtain. Compared to
					others, you are more likely to know other industries strategies and
					tactics, and that may be helpful to your company. <b><i>You
							can transfer your knowledge within the organization, create new
							possibilities for your company.</i></b> Moreover, your conversation
					topics will become more interesting. Anthony Robbins said: “If you
					spend one hour a day to learn about a topic, a year later, in this
					regard, the knowledge you gain will be more than 99.999% of the
					world’s people.” Even if you have 30 minutes every night, each week
					you can easily read a book. You may not be an expert, but I
					promise, you’ll know more than what your peers know.<br> <br></li>

				<li><b>Do some projects:</b> You can apply the knowledge learnt
					to real work scenario, this is only an ideal state. If your company
					did not give you this opportunity, create opportunities for
					yourself. You can do some volunteer projects. They can bring you
					fame. Working with a team, you’ll understand how things work. In
					the practical application of the industry, and how it ultimately
					affect actual customers. You’ll learn how to perform the task and
					meet deadlines, and get feedbacks on what you are doing, and
					benefit from it. When you are not strong enough, these experience
					may not have any value to you. But you are still a novice. these
					experiences are far more valuable than the miserable pay you are
					getting. If you can really convince others of your pockets of
					fruits of labour, Then go try it. But do not let these private jobs
					affect your work.</li>

				<li><b>Actively build your connections:</b> In your career
					path, a strong network of connections will make everything
					accelerate. If you have not set up your own personal connections,
					you’ll need to divide a portion of your time to do this. A strong
					network of relationships, can enable you:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Contact smart friends, and learn their opinions.</li>
						<li>Get information and knowledge that are difficult to
							obtain.</li>
						<li>Help the company look for more potential partners</li>
						<li>Income generating opportunities.</li>
					</ul> <br> Go get to know your work colleague or boss. If you are
					an entrepreneur, your network connections will be your early
					customers, your staffs are a source of capital rather than go home,
					or going to a bar, you should find some inner circles. There are
					many small groups which are highly relevant to your career. You
					should try to integrate into these circles. Every week, you can
					drink coffee together with new friends, go drinking or have
					breakfast. You can also look into everyone’s career developments on
					LinkedIn. And establish a network with mentors in those
					professional industries. They may be your next job employer, who
					knows? Your connections will be your most powerful asset in the
					workplace. Since you have time to watch “The Voice of China”, you
					have time to build a social network.<br> <br></li>

				<li><b>The CHANGE of your LIFE starts TONIGHT:</b> 6 pm to 12
					am, you go home, though physically and mentally tired, you are free
					to do anything and do not have to take orders from others. During
					this time, you can switch off like switching off your computer at
					your workplace, switch off your brain. But you can also do
					something, make you smarter, stronger, have a wider network of
					people. From the start tonight, take an hour a day to do these
					things, I guarantee that after a year, your career, and life will
					change.</li>
